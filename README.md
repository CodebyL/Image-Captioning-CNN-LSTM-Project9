# 🖼️ Image Captioning System (Simulator)
**Project 9 —  C++ Implementation**

**Course:** 420 Artificial Intelligence

## 📖 **Project Description**
This project simulates an **Image Captioning System** using C++.  
It pretends to process images by asking for an image file name and generates a simple caption.  
This represents how a **CNN + LSTM** model would behave, but in a much simpler way.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**
- **Language:** C++
- The program:
  1. Takes an image file name as input.
  2. Matches it to a predefined caption.
  3. Prints the caption.

## 🚀 **How to Compile and Run**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o ImageCaptioning
./ImageCaptioning
```
